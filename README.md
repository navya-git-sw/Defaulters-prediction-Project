# Defaulters-prediction-Project
Objective of the project is to predict the defaulters using ANFIS algorithm on open source data.Built simple ANFIS algorithm to predict the defaulters.

Acknowledgment:

I have read research paper on dynamic methods to predict the defualters and this project was inspired by A dynamic credit risk assessment model with data mining techniques: evidence from Iranian banks by Somayeh Moradi & Farimah Mokhatab Rafiei. However, the work done in this repository is mine. The mentioned paper helped me to experimenting with hybrid/dynamic model to predict the defaulters on open-source data.
